Develop a Personal AI Database for my contacts
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive AI-powered database that catalogs and organizes information about individuals I have met throughout my life, including their skills, experiences, and contact details. This database will serve as a powerful tool to facilitate connections, collaborations, and opportunities tailored to specific needs.

Use Cases

Networking and Collaboration: The database will allow me to quickly identify and connect with individuals who possess specific skills or experiences relevant to my current projects. For example, if I am looking for someone with expertise in music therapy for a community outreach program, the AI can instantly provide a list of contacts who fit that description.

Event Planning: For initiatives such as "Sing with Me" events in nursing homes or community centers, the database can help identify participants who have previously expressed interest in similar activities, ensuring a more engaging and personalized experience.

Resource Sharing: The AI database can facilitate the potential for individuals within the network to help each other based on their skills and experiences, fostering a collaborative environment.
Personalized Outreach: By leveraging the database, I can craft personalized messages to reconnect with individuals based on their past interactions and interests. This could lead to more meaningful conversations and potential collaborations.

How It Could Work

Data Collection: The initial phase will involve gathering data from various sources, including the many audio recordings I have of meeting thousands of individuals on my "Sing With Me" platform. Additional data can be collected through personal voice notes and manual input, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of each contact.

AI Integration: Utilizing AI technologies, we will develop a system that can analyze and categorize the collected data. The AI will be capable of recognizing patterns and extracting relevant information, such as skills, interests, and contact details.

User-Friendly Interface: A user-friendly interface will be designed to allow easy access to the database. I will be able to search for contacts based on specific criteria, such as profession, location, or shared interests.

Continuous Learning: The AI will continuously learn from new interactions and updates, ensuring that the database remains current and relevant. I will also have the ability to update their information, which the AI will incorporate seamlessly.


Collaboration Opportunities

I am looking for a team or individual with expertise in the following areas:
AI Development: Experience in natural language processing and machine learning to build the AI engine.

Database Management: Skills in structuring and managing databases to ensure efficient data retrieval and organization.

Software Development: Ability to create a user-friendly interface and integrate the AI functionalities.

Here is the summary of the interview.

General Summary
Reggie Guillaume emphasized the need for Shane to scale his business by delegating tasks or outsourcing to manage more clients effectively.
Core functionality for the project includes an audio input system to extract data into a database, allowing for queries to gain specific customer insights.
Shane suggested a timeline of 2-3 weeks for the prototype, which Reggie agreed to under the condition of prioritizing quality over speed.
Reggie prefers a gradual payment structure due to financial constraints, advocating for a "slow and good" approach to development.
A simplified prototype may involve separate programs or integration with external ChatGPT for initial referencing to manage the data input process effectively.
The initial focus is on perfecting the data input process using a small dataset before scaling up to larger entries.
Key data points for extraction were identified as job title, location, age, and additional fields like pet ownership for enhanced cross-business referrals.
A strategy was established to test with a few recordings initially, building incrementally to avoid extensive data re-import when adding new fields.
Transition to a custom model from ChatGPT referencing is planned once the dataset reaches hundreds or thousands of entries for improved efficiency.
Shane is currently resolving an issue with his Upwork account hold and will communicate detailed timelines and pricing information via Upwork messaging.

Here is the full script of the interview.

Reggie Guillaume: 00:00 
 Find something that, that works and pay so well, that's pretty much impossible for you to do. Or maybe, maybe it is possible for you to do, but just find a way to just pay somebody else to do what you do, but maybe for cheaper and then you could take on more clients and you just build it from there. So.

Shane P-IRE: 00:16 
 That's a good point.

Reggie Guillaume: 00:17 
 That's pretty much it. Like business is mostly about replacing yourself. Sometimes it's about assembling a team, but it could also be about just making copies of you everywhere, so.

Shane P-IRE: 00:27 
 Exactly.

Reggie Guillaume: 00:28 
 Yeah, yeah. You're, you're not far off. You. Like if you just had a 9 to 5 job, then that would be a bigger question. How do I start my own business? But you, you are doing business. You are doing business and, and you're just. But you're, but you're doing it by mostly, mostly by yourself, right?

Shane P-IRE: 00:45 
 Yeah, I mean I do have some help too. Like. Yeah, I mean there's always got to be a little bit of help additionally and stuff. So. Yeah, like.

Reggie Guillaume: 00:52 
 So then you're a business owner.

Shane P-IRE: 00:54 
 Yeah, I guess I am. Look at that. I never really thought. I mean I've worked nine to five. I've done plenty of tech work, digital marketing, programming and stuff. I've done a lot in my time since college and everything. So I do understand the nuances and. But yeah, this is kind of a new ter. This is a little bit new territory, I guess. A little bit. But not too much because I would d. Plenty of projects very similar and everything. My previous work experience too. So.

Reggie Guillaume: 01:23 
 Awesome, awesome, awesome. Got it, got it. Well, I'm glad that you're working with me.

Shane P-IRE: 01:27 
 Yeah, likewise.

Reggie Guillaume: 01:29 
 So really what I would like to accomplish during this meeting is to know what the next steps are exactly. Like how close how like what the projection is to get like a working prototype where I could input some audio and then their information, the information from the audio will go to a database like a spreadsheet that I could see where specific details are put in about people and I can see the spreadsheet and just make sure that the spreadsheet looks good and that I, I guess that's the first half of it. The other half of the other functionality, at least the, at least the end user functionality would, would be that I can reference the information too with a couple of questions. Like if we put in five people, I can say which one of them. Which one of them is good? Is a, is, is a, is a potential customer for my, for my, for my sign making business or something like that. You Say, well, this guy says that he has a storefront, maybe he might need a sign. So that's what the chat would say back. That's basically the end user functionality that I'd like to be able to put in data from audio or from type notes and be able to reference the database as well with, with, you know, with, with a, with a specific prompts, asking, asking it who is the best or which are the list of people that can contact for this or that reason. So I guess I'd like to know what the timeline is to create a working prototype of that that I can test and how much that working prototype would cost just based on your projection.

Shane P-IRE: 03:08 
 Well, I mean, you saw the plan and everything. Yeah, essentially. I mean it would take a couple weeks to get. It shouldn't be too long, you know, just to get a working prototype, like a beta in place. I'd give it just a couple weeks, two to three weeks perhaps. That's my proposal. As far as the cost, I might have to dissect that a little bit more if that's okay. Like we have a lot, you know, a lot of the resources on hand and everything. But as far as like the overall cost, I might have to, yeah, like I said, I might have to go on to that a little bit further and I can message you back about that after this, if that's okay. Just get it. I mean, I know what I, I was, I just kind of wanted to know what you were thinking too during this meeting, what your projections were as well, like what your timeline is. I mean, I know you want to get this up and running and such, but like what was your timeline type of just to kind of get, you know, like you said you wanted to prototype something that's functioning and then you can at least test and such and have a functionality within it. But what was your projected timeline that you would prefer?

Reggie Guillaume: 04:25 
 Well, I'll tell you this. When it comes to the. I forgot what triangle it is, but the golden triangle here, like high quality, affordable and fast. Yeah, you can only choose. Really? Really? I, you know, I can only choose two of them. Like if, if, if I, if I wanted quality and speed, I would just have to have the money. And obviously, you know, I've been going through financial stuff, so it's not that I have the kind of money for, for, for, for, for fast and good. So I would, I'd rather do slow and good and just pay, you know, know, have enough time to pay over, over time.

Shane P-IRE: 05:03 
 Yeah.

Reggie Guillaume: 05:04 
 So I'm not, I'm not in A huge rush. If I had a. If I had a boatload of cash and I'd be in a rush, but. Okay, I can't afford to be in a big rush. I would rather you take the time and, and make it, you know, make it affordable for me.

Shane P-IRE: 05:16 
 No, that works. Like, that actually is reassuring because, I mean, we could, you know, obviously we could speed up things, make it expedite certain type of situations and such, but if you want it slow and good, I'm. I'm not going to argue with that. Like, I can work with you step by step in that case. And that's why, I mean, I said a couple weeks, which I could do, but if it extends out a little bit, that's not a problem. It sounds just in case because I want to give you the best product possible with what you're asking for. And so, yeah, I mean, I still could abide by a few weeks, but if you're not in a huge rush and you want to make sure that this is up to snuff. Yeah, definitely. I won't push the speed any more than it needs to be. I mean, yeah, you want the final product to be quick and clean, of course, but the actual process, yeah, it. I can go at a. Whatever speed is necessary. Like I said, I have some help too, and we'll work, you know, in increments if we have to, and we can send updates as far as, like, the progress and such, even in between, during. Just to give you an idea so you're not out in the dark during this process and such. But if that's taken up your time and you just want some, like a prototype that's pretty close to ready, we can do that too. So I'm, I'm pretty flexible. We'll just say that. Okay with this project and so whatever you need, Reggie.

Reggie Guillaume: 06:46 
 Like, yeah, yeah, I, I was, I was thinking we could. I was thinking for a prototype, we can, we can even simplify the user experience where it could even be two different programs, or it could be one program that also works with ChatGPT externally. So it could be like, I want to be able to put in audio, right? Audio. Just based off of its understanding of what information I'm looking for. Puts info into the database. Once we have the database, once, we don't necessarily need to create a software to reference it. We can use ChatGPT for that. But obviously when you start to get into the thousands of entries, that's when ChatGPT starts to not be good for that. But the first prototype could just depend on ChatGPT completely. We just want to be able to input people's information into a spreadsheet first. If we want that process, we want the process to be easy. And we wanted to also, we wanted to also put in key information, like I would say, their job title, their location, their age. Maybe, maybe what we, maybe what we could do, right, is put in a few recordings of people and, and then a few data points to make sure that makes the spreadsheet. But then we can look at the spreadsheet and I could test it, I could start referencing it, and then we might find that there's relevant information. The person said that didn't make it into the spreadsheet, particularly because we didn't prompt the. Or I would say, particularly because we didn't make those a relevant data point to the, to the system that we have. Like, you know, maybe we have to be specific and say, do they have pets? Right. Because it might not put in that information. It's like, okay, well, that actually might be relevant. I'm finding that whether they have a pet is quite relevant because I also want to be able to connect this person with my cousin who also grooms pets. So, yeah, yeah, we might not know that the first time around, but then we say, oh, you know, let's, let's actually put that in. Probably with working with just the input system over and over and over and over and over again, we probably just find the kind of data points that are relevant to us to the point where once we have that set, we can just kind of leave it there. Because what we don't want to do is start inputting tons and tons of data and realize certain points are missing and then have to re. Import all the data again.

Shane P-IRE: 09:30 
 Right.

Reggie Guillaume: 09:31 
 We want to just have a lot of practice with just a few recordings and, and then just build as we go so that once we get that system really dialed in and with our first hundred entries, then we could look at. Okay, well, now that we're getting to the hundreds of entries, we want to prepare for what the thousands of entries would look like. And so let's create a model that is designed to reference this way more efficiently than ChatGPT can.

Shane P-IRE: 09:56 
 Okay. Kind of just jotting this down as we go too.

Reggie Guillaume: 10:02 
 Yeah. And I'll send you the Fireflies notes too.

Shane P-IRE: 10:04 
 I figured you would, but I'm doing a little bit of both and that'll, that'll help if you do. For sure. But yeah, no, I, I see what you're saying. I mean, a lot of Data points. Any. I know data is such a buzzword right now, but still like those are key. And so yeah, even if it is an interest or behavioral interest that has like pets involved or heck, some data goes into like what kind of foods they eat and such, you know, it does point in a certain direction. So yeah, I would tell. I. I'm totally on board with that and we can work with that and you know, implement that strategy as well when you are collecting that information from these clients and the recordings and such, you know.

Reggie Guillaume: 10:45 
 Cool.

Shane P-IRE: 10:46 
 100%. Yeah. Like I. You've answered a lot of the questions I've had just talking to you right now and I'm gonna still send you some questions, of course, as the process goes, but I just need to get a few things in order. I don't know if you have any other questions for me or.

Reggie Guillaume: 11:05 
 No, just need a timeline and price and.

Shane P-IRE: 11:08 
 Yeah, I'll get that for you.

Reggie Guillaume: 11:10 
 Yeah, I hope that, I hope that what I just added makes it, makes it more clear what I'm. What I'm looking for for the first round, for the, for the first round of testing and. Yeah, yeah, let me know what if you need to know. If you need to know anything else. Okay.

Shane P-IRE: 11:25 
 Yeah, I mean I'm glad I could have talked your ear off, but I'm not gonna. I think I'll get that timeline as soon as possible in price. I'll get that to you and you know, obviously I'll send it here in upwork and then yeah, we can figure everything else after that. Like whatever you need to send to me. I know my account. It's been weird. I mean, elephant in the room. Like you saw that. Of course. And I'm not sure why. I'm like, so why is the account on hold right now and such? And I provided ID numerous times. I think I logged in from a different location and that might have got their attention. And so yeah, I was. You noticed it. So yeah, so that's getting fixed. I messaged him again. I'm like, you know, I'm here, we talked, we did a face to face just like this and so that'll get fixed. But yeah, I'll get you the timeline and everything else as well. Sure. In the price. So appreciate it. And like I said, if you have any questions, throw them my way.
